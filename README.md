# Collection of methods for object detection

This repository is aimed to help people with object detection method.

I have completed the following topics:
* Pattern matching for 1-D signals

I have plans to write more about:
* 2-D template detection with arbitrary rotation and scale
* Feature extraction via Artificial Neural Networks
* Object detection via ANN

Kudos and copyrights:
The most of the notebooks and scripts are implemented by Andrey Sorokin unless it is atated otherwise.
The licenses will be added later in LICENSE.{type} files.
